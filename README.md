This week we have launched our mass education program about breathing rhythm and its health values also called nasal cycle. Our rhythm of breathing ideally switches from Left-Right-Left in every 2-3 hours. BUT this switch is not guaranteed and often is short, long or erratic for many people.

Many wearable companies often confuse rhythm with temporal distribution of air pressure during inspiration and expiration. But that is just rate of breathing.

As per NCBI of USA, in last 30 years many researchers have proved that rhythm of breathing can both affect and get affected by our body. This control over body or control by body(read mind) depends on our focus on daily lives. Are we trying to control our body or not? This decides the rhythm or nasal cycle as loosely called.

Here are few of the references :

The core purpose of founding #InternetOfHealth is to allow health sector to innovate and disrupt for good. IOH(Internet of health), will be open for all, secure with encryption and anonymous for privacy at device level. These three features are important for smooth operation and trust formation in the network. The network will act as an hybrid of P2P and C-S model with strong P2P centrality.

The data can be further used for more research and development but that will not impact users' privacy in anyway because any dataset will not be personally identifiable. Also there is an already existing large trove of knowledge about breathing from ancient sciences of Vedas, Ruwh and Nadi.

IOH will benefit humanity in more ways than one,

Live & personal health monitoring.
Free and collaborative platform for health services.
Unifier of technology and human integration systems.
Monitor impact of global warming on our societies.
Though founding principles of rhythms are too attached with religious texts of Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam, IOH is for everyone and should never be interpreted as affine to any such establishment.

This text will act as guiding principle of #InternetOfHealth and should be reviewed periodically for adoption of innovation and whitespaces.

The official version of latest IOH principles will be maintained at Githun@Nozpad
